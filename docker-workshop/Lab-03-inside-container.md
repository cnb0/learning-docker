# Docker Workshop
Lab 03: Running commands inside the container

---

## Task

1. Run the same application from previous lab in detach mode (selaworkshops/npm-static-app)
2. Attach to the container
3. what happens when you exit (CTRL + C ) from the attach proceess ? does the container still runs ?
4. Re-Run the container, and enter its terminal (bin/bash) 
5. list all the files and print the current directory
6. **Challange** -> Change the company name from "Company" to your name


## Instructions

 - Run the application in a Docker container (detached mode) using:
```
$ docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name static-app selaworkshops/npm-static-app:latest
```

 - Ensure the container is running:
```
$ docker ps
```

 - Attach to the container process using:
```
$ docker attach static-app
```

 - Exit from the process by enter 
```
$ (CTRL + C)
```

 - Check the running containers:
```
$ docker ps
```

 - If the container was stoped, delete it and run a new container using:
```
$ docker rm static-app
$ docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name static-app selaworkshops/npm-static-app:latest
```

 - Execute the terminal (interactive) inside the container using:
```
$ docker exec -it static-app /bin/bash
```

 - Inspect the container filesystem:
```
$ ls -l
$ pwd
$ cd /
$ ls -l
```

 - Exit from the terminal using:
```
$ exit
```
