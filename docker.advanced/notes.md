- GL340 Course Outline:
 
- This course covers all the core features of Docker including
  container creation and management, interacting with Docker
  hub, using Dockerfile to create and manage custom images,
  advanced Docker networking (how to safely expose container
  services to the world, and link containers), the use of Docker
  volumes to manage persistent data, and Docker Compose
  to build multi-container applications. Emphasis is placed on
  best practices and how to secure Docker installations and
  containers. The course culminates with comprehensive labs
  where students use Docker, Git, and a continuous integration
  server to automate the testing of containerized applications.
