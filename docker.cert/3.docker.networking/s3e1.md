## Bridge Network

*   most common network

*   docker0 network is this

*   isolated layer networks even on same host

*   Create a bridge network
    >   docker network create bay-bridge -d bridge
    >   docker network ls

*   Create a container with the newly created network
    >   docker run -d <image-name> --network bay-bridge ls -ltr

## Overlay Network

*   often called multi-host networks

*   encryption is supported

*   all containers can talk with the overlay network even though the underlying networks are different

*   

## Host Network
