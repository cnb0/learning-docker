# Docker Swarm

Swarm = Secure Cluster + Orchestrator

MTLS = Mutual TLS

## Secure Swarm Cluster

*   contains managers and nodes

*   each of them connected via MTLS

>   swarmkit powers swarm-mode

### Single-Engine mode vs Swarm mode

*   Single Engine Mode

    >   not in a cluster, needs to be contacted individually

*   Swarm Mode

    >   inside a cluster, does not need each container to be contacted individually

## Swarm Cluster Operations

Create a swarm cluster

>   docker swarm init

*   one swarm node will be created, it will be elected as a manager-leader

*   It will have its own CA

*   To pass external CA certs, pass the following:

    >   docker swarm init --external-ca

*   Cluster store is an etcd database

*   Add a node to swarm

    >   docker swarm join <token>

*   RAFT consensus: 3/5/7 managers are required
