# Docker Registries

Typically these are the image stores.

Examples:

*   Google Container Registry: gcr

    https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/

*   Amazon Web Services Elastic Container Registry: ecr

    https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/

*   JFrog artifactory as a container registry:

    https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Getting+Started+with+Artifactory+as+a+Docker+Registry

*   Inhouse Docker Registry as a docker container

    https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/

structure definition:
` REGISTRY/REPO/IMAGE(tag) `

>   docker image pull docker.io/nginx/latest

When images are pushed to registry, images are compressed.

> Distribution hashes

*   When images are compressed, new hashes are generated such that the registry distributes the image with these hashes.
