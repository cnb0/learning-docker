# Working with Docker Containers

>   Copy-On-Write

    *   Anytime a container wants to make change to an existing Docker image, it makes own copy and writes its changes there.

    *   Every container uses the host kernel it is located on.

    *   Containers are all about apps. typically microservices

### Container Operations

*   List all containers

>   docker container ls or docker ps

*   Run a container out of a docker image

>   docker run -it <image-name> /bin/bash

Ctrl+P+Q to exit safely

*   Run container in a detached mode

>   docker run -d busybox ls -ltr

*   Stop a container

>   docker stop <container-id>/<container-name>

*   List all containers (exited and active)

>   docker ps -a

*   Login into a running docker container

>   docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash

```
Runtime arguments while running a container based out of an image take precedence over the CMD instructions

Runtime arguments while running a container based out of an image are appended to the existing ENTRYPOINT commands in the image
