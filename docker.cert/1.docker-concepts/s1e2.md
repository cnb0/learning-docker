* Utilize a registry to store an image

### Understanding images

* Pull an image

```
docker image pull redis
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/redis
Digest: sha256:5534b92530acc653f0721ebfa14f31bc718f68bf9070cbba25bb00bc7aacfabb
Status: Image is up to date for redis:latest
```

```
docker image pull nginx

```

Image is a loosely connected bunch of layers referenced by a manifest file(json) 

When docker pull is issued, an API call is made to hub.docker.com(default)

Step-1: Get manifest

```
Fat Manifest (manifest of manifest) --> Image Manifest
```

Step-2: Pull layers

``` 
Storage driver pulls the image layers. Typically aufs or overlay2

To find the layers downloaded, use: ls -l /var/lib/docker/aufs/diff

Base layer consists of root file system i.e. tmp, mnt, var, etc, bin
```
