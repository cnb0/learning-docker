# Docker Workshop  from Engineers Prespective

## Course Description
The Workshop introduces the fundamental concepts of application containerization to engineers so they are comfortable starting to build, ship, and run containerized applications using Docker.

Docker is making history in the software world. Containers integrate into every part of the application lifecycle, from dev and test all the way to staging and deployment. In this workshop, 
           we will see how containers can do much more than what you came to expect from a VM, 
           how containers help manage application infrastructures, and how to use Docker management tools to manage application scale 
           from a single instance to large clusters. 
           We will discuss Docker history, understand how containers are different from VMs and 
           talk about the Docker file system, install Docker on Linux, macOS, and Windows, build our own container and 
           talk about Docker file definitions, and towards the end of the day discuss some advanced topics such as the 
           Docker Hub, Docker Compose, and others -- all accompanied by hands-on labs.

## Course Objectives

 - Explain the basics of Docker
 - Use Docker for development, QA, Production
 - Create your own containers
 - Learn how to containerize you applications
 - Understand Docker's file system,volumes, networking and mechanisms
 - understand the differences between virtual machines and application containers
 - put the right things in (and keep the wrong things) out of a Dockerfile to maximize efficiency, portability, and security
 - learn to build and publish custom Docker images
 - learn to run containerized applications locally and on servers safely with Docker
 - The Docker workshop is highly interactive  
 
 ## Goals
  Attendees will learn:
  ```
      - how and why containerization works
      - how containerization improves security over existing deployment mechanisms
      - how to simplify application delivery processes by creating, testing, and promoting well-defined application image artifacts
        how to:
             build secure application images
             ship application images to a central artifact repository
             run application images in locally and server clusters
             the architecture, key features, and adoption cycle of the most-common secure container deployment platform options
  ```
