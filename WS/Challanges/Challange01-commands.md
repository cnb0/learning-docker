# Docker Workshop
Challange 01 : install and interact with Redis 

---


## Instructions

 1. in this challange you are required to run a redis docker image.
 2. recall that Redis is combined of the redis server and a CLI tool that ships with the redis binaries.
 3. your goal is to add several keys to redis and use a small program that prints those values.
 4. you can use the Docker Hub Redis Readme that has all the instructions needed for this task :
https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/

5. some helpful redis commands :

```
$ > set "k1" 3
$ > get "k1"
$ > incr "k1"
```


6. Hint : it is always a good practice to read the Docker-hub documentation on how to use the container effectively!
