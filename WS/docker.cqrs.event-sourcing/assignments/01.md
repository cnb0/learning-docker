# Event sourcing the `Meetup` aggregate

Design the `Meetup\Meetup` aggregate in such a way that

- everything that happens to an instance of this class gets recorded as an event inside the object,
- it is possible to retrieve a list of these events from outside the object.

Consider the following questions:

- Which data should be stored in the event objects?
- Would it be a good idea to track commands instead of events?
- Is it even necessary to update the attributes of the aggregate while processing commands?

## Reconstitution

Think of way to reconstruct the aggregate based on the list of events. Hint: add a static method to the `Meetup` class which produces an instance of itself, with all the events re-applied to it.

Consider the following questions:

- Should you validate the method arguments of the *command* methods of an aggregate?
- Should you validate the event data used in the methods that (re)apply the events, before assigning the data to the attributes of the aggregate?
