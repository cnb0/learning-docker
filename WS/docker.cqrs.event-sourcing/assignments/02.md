# Apply CQRS to the `Meetup` aggregate

Define a `UpcomingMeetupForListView` read model which contains the title and date of a meetup. Think of a way to update the read model based on changes that occur in the corresponding `Meetup` aggregate.

Use the `UpcomingMeetupForListViewRepository` to retrieve, save or remove read model instances.

Questions to consider:

- Which events result in adding a read model instance? Which to updating? Which to removing?
- Do we still need query methods on the `Meetup` aggregate?
- Using for example MySQL for persisting this read model, what would the query to select upcoming meetups look like?
- In theory, this read model would never get outdated. In practice though, what will go wrong?
